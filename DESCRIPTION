Description: Collection of plotting and table output functions for data
    visualization. Results of various statistical analyses (that are commonly used
    in social sciences) can be visualized using this package, including simple and
    cross tabulated frequencies, histograms, box plots, (generalized) linear models,
    mixed effects models, PCA and correlation matrices, cluster analyses, scatter
    plots, Likert scales, effects plots of regression models (including interaction
    terms) and much more. This package supports labelled data.
