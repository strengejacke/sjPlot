* `tab_dfs()` also gains a `digits` argument.

## Bug fixes

* Argument `df.method` in `tab_model()` did not accept all available options that were documented.

* The `minus.sign` argument in `tab_model()` now works.
* `show.std = TRUE` in `tab_model()` did not exponentiate standardized coefficients for non-Gaussian models.

# sjPlot 2.8.5

## Changes to functions

* `tab_model()` gains an argument `df.method`, which will replace the less generic `p.val` argument in the future. Currently, `df.method` is an alias of `p.val`.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed issue with wrong n's in `plot_stackfrq()` when weights were applied.
* Fixed issue `plot_stackfrq()` when weights were applied and items should be sorted.

* `tab_model()` now accepts all options for `p.val` that are supported by `parameters::model_parameters()`.

* no longer prints a message that default p-values for mixed models are based on Wald approximation.
* `show.ci50` defaults to `FALSE` now.

### `sjt.itemanalysis()`

* `sjt.itemanalysis()` now works on ordered factors. A clearer error message was added when unordered factors are used. The old error message was not helpful.

* `view_df()` mixed up labels and frequency values when value labels were present, but no such values were in the data.
* Argument `wrap.labels` in `plot_frq()` did not properly work for factor levels.

* `tab_model()` gets additional arguments `vcov.fun`, `vcov.type` and `vcov.args` that are passed down to `sjstats::robust()`, to calculate different types of (clustered) robust standard errors.
* The `p.style`-argument now also allows printing both numeric p-values and asterisks, by using `p.style = "both"`.
